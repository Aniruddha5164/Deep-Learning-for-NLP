**Industry-Specific LLM Bot: Finance**


Welcome to the repository for the Industry-Specific Large Language Model (LLM) Bot project, focusing on the Finance industry. This project is part of a capstone course aimed at developing intelligent bots that can effectively engage with users by answering questions and providing insights specific to chosen industries.

**Project Overview**


This capstone project involves creating a finance-specific LLM Bot using pre-trained models from platforms such as Hugging Face. The project includes the following key stages:

Industry Selection
Data Collection
Model Selection and Training
Bot Development
Demonstration
Research Paper Extension (Future Work)


**Project Objectives**

*Industry Selection*


Chosen Industry: Finance and Banking


Data Collection
Gather relevant data specific to the Finance industry. This includes financial reports, articles, FAQs, customer interaction logs, and more.
Data sources include public datasets, web scraping, APIs, surveys, and company reports.


Model Selection and Training


Utilize a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
Fine-tune the model using the collected finance-specific data.
Training conducted on Google Colab with T4 GPUs, limited to a maximum of 25 epochs.


Bot Development


Develop an LLM Bot that can engage users with accurate, contextually appropriate responses to finance-related queries.
Ensure the bot can handle various types of financial questions and provide insightful answers.
Demonstration


Create an explanatory video showcasing the bot's capabilities in handling finance-specific questions.
Demonstrate the bot's practical applications and its ability to engage in meaningful conversations.
Research Paper Extension (Future Work)


Extend the project into an Industry Immersion module by writing a research paper related to the Finance industry.
Discuss the insights gained during the project and the LLM Bot's development.
